# AutoMobile_System
The automobile system repository provides a desktop-based system for a automobile part shopÂ that was written entirely in the C++ programming language. The system isn't very complex. The only thing a user should do while dealing with the system is to always input data in UPPERCASE LETTERS. They must also not leave any gaps between words/values while entering, and if they do, they must connect the values with a ( _ ) underscore. As a result, one must be aware that the system is case sensitive.

To edit and modify the program, get the assig1.cpp file from the repo and execute it in any IDE that can handle C++ programs (visual studio code is suggested). To execute this program, you must first download and save the assig1.cpp file to a folder before _running it in the terminal_.

The source code and functions used to develop the automobile shop system are listed below.
